                <img src="images/linedrawing.png" alt="line drawing of female working on laptop with coffee" id="lineDrawing">
                <p>I’m a UX/UI Designer based in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. My path into the UX/UI field was a journey that took me across industries, through a variety of areas and roles, and on several scenic detours. Along the way I gained unique transferable skills and worked with many inspiring people and teams everywhere I went.
                </p>
                <p>I am on track to complete my certificate in UX/UI Design through the University of Denver in November 2022. Design is an exciting adventure for me, a chance to explore and continuously learn and apply new technologies, concepts, and techniques. If there’s one thing I’ve learned so far, it’s that a great designer should never be afraid to stop and ask for directions (aka do your research, listen to the user and the client, and adjust accordingly)! It’s crucial to be open to change to make sure your design ends up in the place where both clients and users want it to be. Good thing I love to challenge myself, and I thrive in a dynamic work environment!
                </p> 
                <p>Now I’ve arrived as a designer, but the journey is far from over. Contact me to discuss how we can work together to drive towards the fork in the road where design and usability intersect.

                        <p class="skillsDetail">I believe in the value of conducting user research to gain a better understanding of a problem and how it can be solved. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods to create a data-driven product experience is fascinating to me. I have experience in conducting user interviews, surveys, and secondary research and analysis.

                        <p class="skillsDetail">I keep people at the heart of what I do, creating experiences that focus on the individual person and the best approach to meet their needs. Personas, story mapping, and user journeys help tell the user story and keep a focus on human-centered design.

                        <p class="skillsDetail">It’s exciting to bring ideas to life, beginning with paper sketches, evolving to wireframes, and eventually arriving at beautiful, high-fidelity prototypes. Figma is my tool of choice for wireframing and prototyping. Additionally, with a background in graphic design, colors, fonts, and images are the icing on the cake for me. I use Adobe Creative Cloud for visual design.
